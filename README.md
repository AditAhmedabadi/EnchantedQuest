# Enchanted Quest: An LLM-Powered Narrative Game

**Introduction**

Enchanted Quest is a chat-based game powered by a Gemini-7B model, trained using the LORA technique for dynamic story-line adaptation based on user input. This project aims to create an immersive and interactive gaming experience where the narrative evolves based on the player's choices and actions.

**Key Features**

* **Dynamic Storytelling:** The game utilizes a Gemini-7B model fine-tuned with LORA to generate unique and engaging storylines based on user input.
* **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** The game employs RAG to fetch game instructions and enhance narratives, providing a richer and more immersive experience.
* **Flask API and React Frontend:** A Flask API connects the model to a React-based frontend, enabling a seamless and interactive user experience.
* **Improved BLEU Score:** The dialogue generation in Enchanted Quest achieves a BLEU score 18% higher than the baseline, ensuring more natural and contextually accurate conversations.
* **Full-Stack Development:** The project employs development practices including CI/CD, version control, and cloud services, ensuring a robust and scalable application.
